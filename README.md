# DataWarehouse-AWS

## Building a cheap DataWarehouse for analytics in AWS.

This project consists of the ingestion of data from multiple sources: an API, excel sheets and a PostreSQL database.

The goal is to centralize all important data in a ready-for-analytics repository.


Since we don't have an API, we are going to create a fake one using FastAPI and Faker.
